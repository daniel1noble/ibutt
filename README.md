# ibutt

Package for processing and organising temperature and humidity data generated from iButtons and Hyrdochrons. Only simple functions are available at the moment. 

# Installation instructions

*ibutt* is not on CRAN and installation will require that you install from the githib repo. To do this will require the use of dev tools

```{r}
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
```

To install the local repository to your R library:

```{r}
install_githib("daniel1noble/ibutt")

```

The above should install *ibutt* into your R library and make the functions accessible. Improvements on functions, suggestions for additional functions are very much welcome! There are much better ways to do certain things that might speed things up and improve the package dramatically. If you have suggestions please contact me or put through a pull request.
